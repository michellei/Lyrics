	<h2> Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light
	What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?<br>
	Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight,
	O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? <br>
	And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
	Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. <br>
	Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
	O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
